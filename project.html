							<h1 class="major">Project Ideas</h1>
							<p>IT consists of a wide variety of fields and because of that it is very difficult to come up with a project idea that I can stick with. My idea would be to create an e-commerce application specifically made to be use in Australia. What makes it different from other applications is that this will focus on B2C (business to consumer) as the sellers can be either established brands or newer brands operating in Australia. This provides a chance to both new and old firms looking for a new platform to reach consumers. </p><br>
							<br>
							<p>E-commerce applications in Australia have been established and running for a long time however there is no real significant growth applied to them. For example, Ozbargain.com.au is the most popular choice but for younger consumers the layout of the application may seem outdated and it may be frustrating or confusing to learn. Other e-commerce applications are not as well-known however and this provides an opportunity to create a new application that can work similarly to E-Bay, Amazon, Alibaba, etc. Most of these are E-commerce sites, however creating an application instead may be more interesting because nowadays most people use their smartphones or tablets more frequently hence creating an application may attract younger consumers instead.</p><br> 
							<br>
							<p>Relying on new platforms may give an advantage to firms in the Australian market since the youth are depending more on technology. It can be easier for firms to reach out to new consumers, especially for new brands which a lot of people might not have heard about. The application will require users to create an account using their email address to logon. In case for firms, there must be a procedure of creating an account such as filling in legal information, along with brand description and the type of products that they sell. This kind of procedure is to ensure the brand is not a scam and to avoid that there must be strict regulations. Before being able to create the account, they can contact the application developers via email to inquire about it. Users will also be asked for personal details such as full name, age, address, email and lastly contact number. On the home page, it should display the highest rated products being sold to consumers. The rating can be viewed by the best reviews and ratings given by consumers which will be calculated to provide an estimate score out of a maximum 10. As users scroll through, each product should have a clear image to see beside the textbox, which consists of the full name of the product, the brand selling it and finally the review score of the product. When users click on the icon of the product they are looking for, it should open a new page that shows full information about it. It should also consist of a lengthy description of the product and reviews and ratings made by consumers below the description. Somewhere in between, there should be the purchase option where consumers will have to fill in contact information. All of the firms must provide shipping, whether it be free or paid because if not then it wouldn’t work using the application. If consumers have inquiries, they should be able to contact the firm. The contact information should be displayed in the page as well. The application should calculate the estimated price including shipping fees if there are any. Through selling the products, the firms must pay 10% commission to app developers which can be used as their main source of funding. An inbox will be implemented into the application where firms should be responsible to generate messages to users to inform them about the shipping progress and any problems should it occur. After users have received the product, users should give a rating score out of 10 and provide reviews.</p><br> 
							<br>
							<p>Creating the project in the form of an application, I should be prepared with learning how to code using Java and Swift. Java will be used to create the Android version as majority of applications created specifically for Android uses Java. Learning C++ and C can also be helpful however Java should still be the main priority. Swift is known to be used for iOS applications thus it will also be prioritized along with using Java. As for hardware, the necessary equipment would be laptops/PC to create the application however using an Apple laptop would be more beneficial as Swift is designed for Apple and Java can be used with different platforms. I will also need two different phones, one that uses Android and the other with iOS to run tests with the application.</p><br>
							<br>
							<p>I will need to be familiar with both Java and Swift to ensure the software will run as expected. Since I do not have a MacBook, it will be essential to adjust getting used to it especially with iOS. I am already familiar with using Android thus that won’t be too much of an issue. Learning Swift shouldn’t be too much of an issue if I can learn Java. However, getting access to products that use iOS might be the issue.</p><br> 
							<br>
							<p>If the application becomes a success, it will provide better opportunities for the Australian market and brands will have more exposure using the new platform. Consumers will most likely rely on using the application instead of having to visit stores. It can also provide opportunities for developers to join and improve the application. To conclude, brands will have to adjust to a new environment of selling to consumers along with ensuring that the Australian market still progresses.</p><br>
