							<p>IT consists of a wide variety of fields and because of that it is very difficult to come up with a project idea that I can stick with. My idea would be to create an e-commerce application specifically made to be use in Australia. What makes it different from other applications is that this will focus on B2C (business to consumer) as the sellers can be either established brands or newer brands operating in Australia. This provides a chance to both new and old firms looking for a new platform to reach consumers. </p><br/>
							</br>
							<p>E-commerce applications in Australia have been established and running for a long time however there is no real significant growth applied to them. For example, Ozbargain.com.au is the most popular choice but for younger consumers the layout of the application may seem outdated and it may be frustrating or confusing to learn. Other e-commerce applications are not as well-known however and this provides an opportunity to create a new application that can work similarly to E-Bay, Amazon, Alibaba, etc. Most of these are E-commerce sites, however creating an application instead may be more interesting because nowadays most people use their smartphones or tablets more frequently hence creating an application may attract younger consumers instead.</p><br/>
