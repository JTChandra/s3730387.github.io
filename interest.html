							<p>I started to become interested in IT when I started high school as I took computer science as my science subject. IT is a unique subject and I found programming to be the most interesting aspect. Although I am aware that IT is a challenging subject, I still decided to choose IT as my major because all around the world, IT and other related fields will be important in the future whilst also having the biggest potential to grow. Being involved in the IT industry is a very exciting prospect as nowadays everything is connected to technology one way or another. Although there is no specific person that inspires me to learn more about technology, the way technology continues to progress is what keeps me interested. It is possible to say that technology is unpredictable and there are still unknown potential and possibilities people can explore. I decided to join RMIT because it is considered to be one of the leading universities in the world for IT. Aside from that RMIT has a good reputation for having practical courses and I believe that it makes RMIT stand out from other universities in Australia. Learning the course with a practical approach seems very helpful because it can better prepare us for our future career. If students can only learn academically, it would be more challenging to apply that to their working experience. I expect to learn crucial skills that will be necessary for my future career such as working in groups, develop better academic skills in areas such as programming, etc.
