							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My name is Jason Theodore Chandra and I am an 18-year-old student from Indonesia, currently studying at RMIT University. My student number is S3730387. Before enrolling in RMIT, I studied in Indonesia where I graduated there and received my high school diploma as well as my IB diploma. 
							Although I was born and raised in Indonesia, my ethnicity is Chinese thus I am considered as Chinese Indonesian. I can speak 2 different languages, English being my main language while I consider Bahasa Indonesia as my second language. My hobby is playing video games and aside from that, I enjoy watching reading books. Before moving to Australia to start university I have visited Melbourne once before and after staying for some time during holidays, I was convinced that Melbourne would be the perfect city to study at.</p>

						        <p>The results of these studies are to show a general idea of my personality and learning styles. Based of the results I can conclude that the accuracy of the test is not the best however it is correct to a certain extent. 
							It should be enough to show a brief perception of what my personality is like to future employers. It can also be a way to assess my personality and areas that I should work on to improve further. Since I also rely on feeling more than thinking, 
							it will be easier for me to sympathize with other members especially when there is conflict within the team. 	
							After assessing the results based off the three tests, it may have a slight issue and disadvantage when working in a team considering that I am mostly introverted. I slowly express myself as an extrovert only to people I can consider as close friends but aside from that I find it rather difficult to immediately adapt to new surroundings. 
							It means that it might also take some time for me to adjust and become comfortable with a new team. I am a visual learner thus it will be easier for me if my group members show me directly how something works in order to maximize the best method to learn. 
							When forming a team, we must ensure that everyone can co-operate and work together well. Personally, I do not have issues working with other people if we can communicate without having misunderstandings or internal conflicts with one another. Aside from that at least one member must have good leadership skills to help lead the team. 
							If everyone is too competitive, it will become frustrating because instead of working together to help one another, the members will instead work against each other for their personal benefit. Being someone who is prospecting (based off the Myers-Briggs test), it can be easier for other group members to work with since I can be more flexible and less pressured when unexpected issues arise.</p>
