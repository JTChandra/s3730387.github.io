<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>My name is Jason Theodore Chandra and I am an 18-year-old student from Indonesia, currently studying at RMIT University. My student number is S3730387. Before enrolling in RMIT, I studied in Indonesia where I graduated there and received my high school diploma as well as my IB diploma. Although I was born and raised in Indonesia, my ethnicity is Chinese thus I am considered as Chinese Indonesian. 
I can speak 2 different languages, English being my main language while I consider Bahasa Indonesia as my second language. My hobby is playing video games and aside from that, I enjoy watching reading books. Before moving to Australia to start university I have visited Melbourne once before and after staying for some time during holidays, I was convinced that Melbourne would be the perfect city to study at.</p>
