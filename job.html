							<p>My ideal job should enable me to keep developing and improve my skills while providing different opportunities. The job as shown above can be accessed by the link (https://www.seek.com.au/job/36768911?type=standard) found from seek.com.au. The job requires a candidate who is specialized in coding using Java. The firm also requires someone who is willing to work together in a team filled with experienced people and has experience for at least 3 year. I found this job position to be interesting because it solely focuses on technological working environment. While looking through different job positions, I noticed that some firms focus their work for different working fields, for example creating software for financial firms, etc. whilst this firm promises the candidate that they will be working in R&D sector. Candidates are provided with the opportunity to work with experienced people hence it is possible to learn more from senior employees. 

As a software engineer, I need to be aware of how I can work together with different people on the same coding project. As different people have different preferences on how they prefer to code, an essential skill is to learn to cope with these differences because if I cannot adjust to this kind of situation, it would be impossible for me to continue working in this job. Aside from that I must have in-depth knowledge of one specific coding language and in this case, it is Java. I have little experience in coding however let alone work in a team to create a software. My current skills are far from being sufficient to achieve the skills required for the job, since I am only able to create simple programs in Java. 

In my current semester I am already enrolled in classes such as Introduction to Programming, Introduction to Information Technology, Database Concepts and User-Centered Design and thanks to these courses I can learn more about programming using Java and additional skills including basic knowledge of HTML, UX/UI and SQL programming. However, I will be focusing mostly on Introduction to Programming as it will build the fundamental skills that are crucial to achieve the ideal job that I look for. Aside from taking the classes, I will be looking for different materials such as reading books that focuses to help on teaching Java and online videos that teach Java which can be found from sites such as YouTube.
